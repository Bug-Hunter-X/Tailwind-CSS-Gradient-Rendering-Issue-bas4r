```html
<!-- Ensure you have the correct Tailwind version and plugins installed -->
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This solution involves verifying the Tailwind CSS version and plugin setup.  Make sure you have a recent version of Tailwind and the `tailwindcss-gradient` plugin (if using it) properly installed and configured according to the official documentation. If not using a plugin, ensure that your Tailwind configuration includes the necessary gradient utilities.
